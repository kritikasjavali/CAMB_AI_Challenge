# CAMB AI Challenge

## To create a virtual environment run the following commands in the terminal:
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
```
virtualenv {name_of_environment}
```
```
source name_of_environment/bin/activate
```

## To install all requirements, run this command in the terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The code has a src folder, with the fucntions for the overall logic. There is a main file, which is the entry point to the code. I have also included a python notebook called CAMB_AI_Challenge which includes the entire workflow.

It can be run by using the command in the terminal:
```
python main.py
```
